Algorithm for Operating Servo Motors to Mimic Robot Walking
<div dir="rtl">
<br>
  First, we observe the robot's movement and see that it involves repeating steps where the feet alternate, with one foot moving before the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second, there are 6 servo motors, 3 for each foot. For example, the right foot has a motor at the upper joint, the knee joint, and the foot joint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third, connecting the electronic components
  <br>
  <br>
  First, connect the power and ground from the Arduino to the breadboard.
  <br>
  Second, connect each servo to the signal pins on the Arduino.
  <br>
  Third, connect all power and ground pins from the servos to the breadboard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth, writing the code
  After uploading to the Arduino, we include the servo library and then define the motors and their connections. We write functions to repeat the movement of the feet continuously.
